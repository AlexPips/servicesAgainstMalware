1. [AWS address ranges](https://ip-ranges.amazonaws.com/ip-ranges.json)
  - Create a [radix tree](https://blog.sqreen.com/demystifying-radix-trees/) where we store the IP prefixes of the AWS EC2 services
  - Get the IP prefixes of AWS from the URL above
  - For every IP returned by Shodan check if it's whithin the IP range of AWS
    - If it is, check for open ports and potential documented vulnerabilities
    
 2. [Blacklisted IPs](https://github.com/firehol/blocklist-ipsets/)
   - A blacklist is a collection of IPs that have been found to conduct a range of attacks (spamming, DDoS, malware delivery, phising)
   - The repository above collects IPs from many different blacklists and commits a snapshot daily
   - Clone the repository and check how many of the IPs of AWS services according to step 1 are blacklisted
